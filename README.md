# üêç Intro to Programming - Python Homework Assignments
Welcome to my collection of Python homework assignments from my Intro to Programming course. These files document my learning journey through core programming concepts, problem-solving exercises, and small projects.

## üìö Course Overview
This course covered the following topics:

- Python syntax and variables
- Conditional logic and loops
- Functions and modularity
- Working with files
- Intro to graphics with Turtle
- Basic game design with logic

## üìÅ Files & Descriptions

- `Homework2_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Early practice with variables, user input, and arithmetic operations.

- `Homework3_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Introduces conditionals and loops for basic decision-making programs.  
  *(Note: a duplicate is saved as `Homework3_Kayley_Chery copy.py`.)*

- `Homework4_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Focuses on `if/else` logic, iteration, and simple functions.

- `Homework5_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Builds on previous work with more complex logic and loop structures.

- `Homework6_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Starts using functions and introduces file I/O operations.

- `Homework7_Kayley_Chery.py`  
  ‚û§ Works with lists and introduces basic data processing.  
  *(Note: duplicate named `Homework7_Kayley_Chery copy.py` is also included.)*

- `theturtle copy 2.py`  
  ‚û§ A Turtle graphics-based assignment demonstrating loops and drawing with code.

- `blackjack.py`  
  ‚û§ A simple Blackjack game implementation, applying conditionals, loops, functions, and randomness ‚Äî a great wrap-up project!
